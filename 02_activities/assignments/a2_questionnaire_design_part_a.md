# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part A)

## Requirements
Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.


### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.


# Your Changes

The number of your chosen topic: `#`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
This survey aims to explore how age influences music preferences, particularly in how different age groups perceive popular music. It seeks to identify patterns in how individuals' tastes change over time and whether these shifts vary between generations. The goal is to understand if and how perceptions of popular music evolve as people age.
```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
Target Population
The target population for this study consists of adults aged 18 and older who listen to music on a regular basis. This includes individuals from various age groups, backgrounds, and music consumption habits, ranging from young adults to older adults. The focus is on individuals who are familiar with popular music, as their perceptions are critical to understanding the influence of age on music preferences.

Sampling Frame
The sampling frame will include users of online music streaming platforms, social media communities, and forums where discussions around music are prevalent. Additionally, participants may be recruited through email lists, music-related social media groups, and academic or workplace networks to ensure a diverse range of responses across different age groups and demographics.

Sampling Units
The sampling units are individual respondents who are willing to participate in the survey. Each sampling unit will be an adult who fits the target population criteria, has access to the survey, and consents to provide information about their music preferences and perceptions.

Observational Units
The observational units are the responses collected from each individual survey participant. These responses will include quantitative data (e.g., ratings on a Likert scale) and qualitative data (e.g., open-ended responses about music preferences). Each respondent's answers will be analyzed to draw conclusions about the relationship between age and perceptions of popular music.
