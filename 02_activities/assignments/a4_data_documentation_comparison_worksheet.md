Captive Study: All 15 bats participated in experiments, but not all trials resulted in quantifiable data.                                                                                          |

Fecal samples analyzed using DNA barcoding for dietary analysis.
Prey species identified using mitochondrial gene sequences compared to the Barcode of Life Data System.
Captive Samples:
Video and audio recordings analyzed for echolocation behaviors.
Measurements of flight paths, pulse intervals, and call frequencies.
                                                                                            |

Imputation: No imputation for missing data; unrecorded behaviors or undetected prey were classified as unknown.                                                                                        |

Guano samples may not represent the full dietary range due to time constraints on sample collection.
Limited reference sequences in the database could lead to unidentified prey species.
Captive Study:
Bats were naive to insect prey, so behavior may not fully replicate wild insectivory.
Echolocation call intensities measured in flight rooms might underestimate wild behaviors.
                                                                                          |

Field samples were from a single geographic location, which might not represent the broader population.
Captive bats had generations of controlled diets, potentially altering natural behavior.                                                                                          |
